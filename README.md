# NPR--Number_Plate_Recognition

To demo this Project:
  - run npr_clf.py
  - enter the image names in directory 'demoData', 'demoData/NP_image1.jpg' for instance.


This is my project for Pattern Recoginition. 
The Goal is to develop a Number Plate Recognition System, which could tell what's the number plate on the input image. 

The whole project could be divided into:
- Preprocessing
  - plate localization
  - character segmentation
- Feature Extraction
- Plate Reconition
